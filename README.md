## 🛠️ Skills & Techniques demonstrated

### 🧩 Project Data Architecture & Process Overview
Developed a **centralized data analytics system** tracking more than **200 strategic indicators** measuring Morocco’s international positioning across economic, social, and institutional dimensions.

### 🔹 Data Integration & Warehouse Design
Collected data from multiple **official sources** — IMF, World Bank, UNICEF, UNESCO, Bank Al-Maghrib, UNDP, FAO, and national statistics offices — into a **centralized data warehouse**.

The model included:
- A **fact table** for indicator measurements  
- **Dimension tables** for indicators, themes, and data sources  
- Supporting tables for definitions and analytical commentary  

This enabled **automation, scalability, and traceability** of each data update.

### 🔹 Automation & Power BI Integration
- Power BI connected directly to the data warehouse for **automated refreshes**  
- Incremental data loading reduced refresh times significantly  
- Analytical comment tables added qualitative context alongside metrics  

### 🔹 Simplified Data Model

Indicators ───▶ Measurements ───▶ Analysis_Comments ───▶ Definitions
